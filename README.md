Simple implementation of the [100 prisioners problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/100_prisoners_problem) (a variation of [Monty Hall paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem))


## How to Run

To run the problem, you must first compile the java file. for simplicity use your favorite Java IDE.
After that, you can run the compiled class from your IDE or from a command line interface using the following commands:



####for the one round (execution of the problem)

    java -cp bin HundredPrisioners


####or for an arbitrary number of rounds (so you can get a feeling of the success rate of the strategy)

    java -cp bin HundredPrisioners 10000
